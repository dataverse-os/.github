## Dataverse Hyper Cloud
Dataverse Cloud is a decentralized cloud-based personal drive. It serves as a private cyber space for individuals and also provides a scalable, secure storage solution for dApps. Your interactions with applications generate data, and the data is stored in your personal drive. It's fully controlled by your wallet and applications will be revolving around you because they need your consent for accessing your data.

## SDK
The OS can be extended by dApps. We provide a SDK for developers to build dApps on top of the OS. This could ease the development of dApps by providing storage, identity, encryption, monetization solutions and enhance UX by uniting different applications.

## Dataverse Network
With ownership ensured, everyone should be able to monetize their data. Dataverse Network is designed to bridge the gap between off-chain personal data and on-chain DeFi. It powers trustless data marketplace by enabling smart contracts to verify the authenticity of off-chain data.
