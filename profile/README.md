# Wallet = Computer

DataverseOS is a Web3-native data operating system driven by digital wallet. It provides an [Identity Computer](https://dataverse-os.com) for users to maintain data ownership and identity sovereignty, and a programmable data layer for developers to create next-generation storage dApps with web scalability and interoperability. Our vision is to reform today's centralized internet towards a user-owned, autonomous world.
