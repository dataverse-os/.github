## Wallet as Sovereign Computer

DataverseOS brings a new data paradigm for individuals to regain control over personal data using a single wallet. The core is an Internet Kernel, which transforms browser & wallet into self-sovereign computer and run web-scale DApps over decentralized stacks. 

### Dataverse Wallet

Data Wallet is the gateway to your own computer. It is built upon Sign-In-with-Ethereum Standard and Object Capability, allowing users to control encryption keys over data files through Decentralized Key Management and Databases.

### Dataverse HyperCloud

Not a single decentralized Dropbox, Dataverse HyperCloud is a set of DApp clouds with fine-grained resource control, ensuring cross-app data security. It serves as secure cyberspace & a sovereign web built for individuals —— your digital footprints are automatically stored in encrypted clouds. 

### Dataverse Connector SDKs

The operating system exposes programmable runtimes to DApps. Developers can integrate built-in identity, storage, encryption and monetization solutions to power web3 social networks, cloud storage, DAOs, AI data marketplaces and more.

### Dataverse Network

Our vision is to secure individuals' data ownership and unlock data economy, so everyone can stand a chance to monetize data value. Dataverse Network is designed to tokenize data generated over computer, and create composable data legos to bridge the gap between off-chain personal data and on-chain DeFi. It will be a public network that allows different kinds of wallets to access.
